# next annoying issue was the azure cli step runs in a linux only container that fails on Windows runner!
# so we have to switch to a linux based job to do the deploy piece, arrrg
# that means we have to upload the results of the build as an artifact so we can retrieve it over in the linux runner
# artifact pattern from here: https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action#operating-system-support-
